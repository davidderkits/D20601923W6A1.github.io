  <main>
    <p>Building credit begins with being an authoried user on an existing account, a credit-builder loan,
      or secured credit card.</p>
    <h2 class="summary">Authorized User</h2>
      <p>Becoming an authorized user is a quicker method for obtaining the card's credit history while enabling a faster FICO score. 
      As an authorized user, there is no requirement to use or possess the card to receive these benefits.</p>
    <h2 class="summary">Credit-building Loan</h2>
      <p>A credit-building loan is similar to a savings plan; typically, a lender holds the funds until the loan is paid in full. 
      Credit unions and community banks offer these loans. If you require the money sooner, another option in this area is a 
      secured loan which involves collateral, and this could be the direct deposit of your paycheck. </p>
    <h2 class="summary">Secured Credit Card</h2>
      <p>A secured credit card is similar to a credit-building loan, whereas the line of credit extended equals the amount of deposit. 
      A secure credit card can be utilized just as a typical credit card with scheduled payments and interest. </p>
